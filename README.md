# Mint
A Lightweight Command Line Game Engine

## The Idea
*Based on NCurses, you've got your windows - in mint they are called scenes (like Unity)
*Scenes have object hierarchies like in unity, but everything is determined in 2D coordinates not 3D
*objects has transforms - mainly position, maybe I'll deal with rotation and scale
*objects can have a charMesh - basically the ncurses equivalent of a mesh - its basicallt a textfile showing the ascii *characters, and other basically vert attrib arrays (like defining a texture by saying the color at each position)
*charRenderer has a charBody and a charMaterial - basically a shader equivalent - takes in the charMesh and renders it to window
